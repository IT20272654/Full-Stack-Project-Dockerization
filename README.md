# Full-Stack-Project-Dockerization
This project demonstrates the containerization of a full-stack web application using Docker and Docker Compose. It features a React (Vite) frontend and a Node.js (Express) backend, each running in separate containers. With Docker Compose, all services can be launched simultaneously using a single command, simplifying development and deployment.
